# Homework: Basic Game Page

***We are currently assembling this exercise... Do not attempt to get started on it yet... at least not until this message is removed.***

The overall goal of this exercise is to give you the chance to practice your basic structural HTML 

Your assignment is to create a "Basic Game Page" for an existing video or tabletop game of your choice.  It will have all or most of the same features as you create with your partner for the "Dig Dug" ICE.

## Here's a list of what you need:
- Content from a web source (either Moby Games or Board Game Geek)
    - A Short Description.
    - Publishing info in the form of a bulleted list.
    - A quote from a review.
    - A list of terms and their values.  Such as "Genre: action"
    - A couple of images of the game (ie: screenshots or pictures of game components)

- Proper HTML structure.
    - Proper Minimal Document Structure (html/head/body)
    - Headings, paragraphs, line breaks, and a block quote.
    - Properly formatted lists (both bulleted) and (definition list)
    - Validate your code.

- CSS applied.
    - Through an embedded or external style sheet. 
        - You can link to an external style sheet (such as Marx or Bootstrap Reboot) by adding the following code to your document's `head` section:  
        `<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="stylesheetfilename.css">`
