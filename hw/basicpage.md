# Homework: Basic Game Page

***We are currently assembling this exercise... Do not attempt to get started on it yet... at least not until this message is removed.***

The overall goal of this exercise is to give you the chance to practice your basic structural HTML 

Your assignment is to create a "Basic Game Page" for an existing video or tabletop game of your choice.  It will have all or most of the same features as you create with your partner for the "Dig Dug" ICE.

## Here's a list of what you need:
- Content from a web source (either [Moby Games](https://www.mobygames.com/) or [BoardGameGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/))
    - A Short Description.
    - Publishing info in the form of a bulleted list.
    - A short list of terms/categories and their values.  Such as "Genre: action, Players: 2-4"
    - A quote from a review.
    - A couple of images of the game (ie: screenshots or pictures of game components)
    - A link to the web source & and link to the quoted review.

- Proper HTML structure.
    - Proper Minimal Document Structure (`!DOCTYPE, <html>, <head>, <body>`)
    - Different levels of headings, paragraphs, line breaks as appropriate, and a block quote.
    - Insert your images where appropriate (just keep them from being HUGE at this point)
        - They should be stored in a subfolder and linked with relative URLs.
    - Properly formatted lists (both bulleted) and (definition list)
    - Appropriate semantic structural tags, such as: `<main>, <header>, <footer>`
    - Links to the sources of your game information and the source of the review quote.
    - Validate your code.

- Simple CSS applied.
    - Through an embedded or external style sheet. 
        - You can link to an external style sheet (such as Marx or Bootstrap Reboot) by adding something like the following code to your document's `head` section:  
        `<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="stylesheetfilename.css">`
        
## Submission

- Upload your page into your 235 directory on Banjo.
