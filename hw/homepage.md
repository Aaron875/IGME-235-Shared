# Homework: Create a 235 home page

## I. Overview
For this assignment you will create a personal 235 "home page" where you will be able to post links to the projects you will complete for this course.

## II. Requirements
* The page will be named index.html
* The page will be located at `http://people.rit.edu/yourid/235/`

Your page's design is up to you, but it needs to contain the following elements:
* A level-1 heading that reads "YOUR NAME's 235 Page" (replacing "YOUR NAME" with your own name, obviously)
* A **recognizable** photo of yourself (not the back of your head, not a drawing, not you wearing a mask)
* A brief bio about yourself (a paragaph will do), telling us about your interests and your goals; what do you hope to get out of the class, your major, your time at RIT, and where do you want to be when you graduate?
* Placeholder links to each of the 3 class projects.
* You do not need to create links to your past homework exercises, but you are welcome to do so if you wish.
* A link to your GitHub repo for this class
* A pleasing (or at least tolerable) color scheme and layout, using your [CRAP](http://www.presentationzen.com/chapter6_spread.pdf) principles and other design guidelines
* You should use an *external CSS* file for all of your styles.
* Your CSS should include at least 2 ID selectors and 2 class selectors
  - You may also use Flexbox and/or CSS Grid techniques to improve the design and layout of your page.
* You must also change all the anchors on your page to match your color scheme (changing all four states)
* Your page needs to pass validation on [Validator.nu](https://html5.validator.nu/) and the W3C [CSS Validator](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
