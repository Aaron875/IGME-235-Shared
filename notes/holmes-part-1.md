# Holmes Part I

## I. Overview

Your mission (in 3 parts):
  1) take some existing content web content (text & 2 images), and mark it up with appropriate *structural* and *semantic* HTML5 elements in order to make the content more accessible:
    - to *search engines* AND
    - *users* - both users surfing the web with a typical web browser, and those using screen readers
  1) style the content for a typical desktop web browser so that:
    - there is an aesthetic improvement over the default version AND 
    - the page is laid out in a single column layout with a small gutter
  1) use *responsive design* techniques to style the content so that it looks acceptable at typical phone and tablet screen resolutions

## II. Start Files

- here are the image files [holmes-images.zip](_files/holmes-images.zip)
- here is the text content:

**holmes-start.txt**

This is just text - you'll need to add ALL of the HTML elements yourself

```html

```

## III. Instructions

1) Rename the file to **holmes.html**
2) Add all of the "boilerplate" you need to make this a minimal HTML document (i.e. `<html>`, `<head>`, `<title>`, `<body>` etc.. there is example boilerplate in our GitHub notes, as well as in previous exercises
3) Head to https://validator.w3.org and be sure that your page is valid HTML
4) Now add some *structure* to the page - i.e. `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<main>` etc... consider all of these tags listed in the following MDN article, but you don't have to use them all:
  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Document_and_website_structure#HTML_for_structuring_content
5) Add more structure and semantics to the page by marking up text elements - examples `<p>`, `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<address>`, `<em>` and so on 
6) Add the **holmes.jpg** and **john-watson-medium.jpg** images to the page
7) Add your name to the bottom of the page - something like this "*Ace Coder's* markup & CSS copyright 20XX"
8) Validate the HTML again
9) See myCourses for submission instructions


## IV. Screenshot of today's version

***Here's an example - without any CSS or presentational markup it's NOT at all attractive, but it is readable!***

***That is, it's readable when it's not seen as a scaled-down image like we have below***
