# Holmes Part I

## I. Overview

Your mission (in 3 parts):
  1) take some existing content web content (text & 2 images), and mark up with appropriate *structural* and *semantic* HTML5 elements in order to make the content more accessible:
    - to *search engines* AND
    - *users* - both users surfing the web with a typical web browser, and those using screen readers
  1) style the content for a typical desktop web browser so that:
    - there is an aesthetic improvement over the default version AND 
    - the page is laid out in a single column layout with a small gutter
  1) use *responsive design* techniques to style the content so that it looks acceptable at typical phone and tablet screen resolutions
  
## II. Screenshots of completed versions

Here's an example, yours will likely look different.
