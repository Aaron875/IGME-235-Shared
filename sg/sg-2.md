## Chapter 4 - Creating a Simple Page
*This fairly short chapter covers how to construct a simple web page and add styles to it. Most of this should be review of concepts that we have already govered in class.*

Here are the 5 basic steps of creating a web page:

**Step #1** - Start with *content* - in this instance the content is about a fictional restaurant

**Step #2** - Give the document *structure* - you do this defining areas of the document such as the &lt;head>, &lt;body> and &lt;title>

**Step #3** - Identify text elements that you can "mark up"

**Step #4** - Add an image

**Step #5** - Change how the text looks with a style sheet

1. Follow the instructions on pages 49-54 and create a new empty plain-text document with your preferred text editor. Name the file **index.html**

2. The text content for the page is information about the *Black Goose Bistro*, which can be found in the **LWD Chapter 4** materials in the myCourses content area. There is also an image there that you will need later on.

3. Go ahead and load the page into a browser. As you can see, all of the text is squished together.
