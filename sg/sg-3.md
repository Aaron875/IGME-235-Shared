## Chapter 5 - Marking Up Text
*This chapter introduces MANY elements for marking up text content. The elements we choose to markup our content with must be chosen **semantically** - which is in a way that most accurately describes the contentâ€™s meaning. If you don't like how the content looks when marked up with a particular element, then you can change that appearance in a stylesheet (which we'll be covering soon!)*

1. Paragraphs (`&lt;p>&lt;/p>`) are almost always displayed on a new line with a little bit of space above and below (this is called `display:block` in CSS), and paragraphs are allowed to contain text, images, and other *inline* elements (such as `&lt;em>`). Below, give examples of elements that paragraphs are NOT allowed to contain (this will be enforced by an HTML validator - i.e. a page with these elements will fail the validator):

2. How many levels of heading elements are there? 

3. Which level of heading is given the most weight by search engines?

4. Which element used to be called a "horizontal rule", but it now called a "paragraph-level thematic break"?

5. Below, write the HTML necessary for an *unordered list* of the colors red, green, and blue:

6. Now do the same thing, except with an *ordered list*. You also need to add an *attribute* such that the list begins at 10 instead of at 1:

7. Note the side bars on page 77 that discuss *nested* lists, and changing the default appearance of list bullets and numbers. 

    *No answer required*

8. Which element is used to denote *long quotations*?

9. Which element preserves *whitespace* (extra spaces, tabs, line breaks, etc) and renders the content in a constant-width font?

10. If we wanted to add a caption to image, which two elements could we use?

11. Go ahead and grab tapenade.txt from the **LWD Chapter 4** files in mycourses, and paste the content into a new file named tapenade.html (see below for the starter HTML)


**tapenade.html**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8" />
	<title>Put your title here</title>
</head>
<body>
Put your content here
</body>
</html>
```
