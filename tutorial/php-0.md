# About this PHP Tutorial Series
## I. Overview
This series of tutorials/lecture notes will get you started exploring the capabilities of the PHP server-side programming language.

## II. How to get the most out of these tutorials
- Try out the code samples! Tweak and modify them! Most of the code samples are 100% complete. You just need to copy the code and paste it into a text file, and save them to a web server. You can then make changes to the code and preview them in a web browser (we will be using Chrome)
- Be sure to complete the associated Study Quizzes on myCourses, and to do the In-Class exercises.
- Check out the PHP resources, sample code, and demos that we link to.
