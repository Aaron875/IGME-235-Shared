# Exercise: PHP ICE 3

## `$_SERVER` Practice

### Do this now:

1. Duplicate *[php-arrays-8.php](php-3.md#section6)*, rename it to **php-ex-3.php** and:
    1. add 3 more echo statements that include information on the server's IP address, the server software, and the server "request time".     2. format the server time to be human readable by using PHP's date function:  http://php.net/manual/en/function.date.php

When you are done, it will look something like this:
