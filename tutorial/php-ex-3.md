# Exercise: PHP ICE 3

## `$_SERVER` Practice

### Do this now:

Duplicate *[php-arrays-8.php](php-3.md#section6)*, rename it to **php-ex-3.php** and:

1. add 3 more echo statements that include information on the server's IP address, the server software, and the server "request time".
1. format the server time to be human readable by using PHP's date function:  http://php.net/manual/en/function.date.php

    When you are done, it will look something like this:

    ![Screenshot](_images/php-arrays-4.jpg)

1. Post a copy of that file on banjo and confirm that it works.  (Only one post needed per group)
1. Store the file for later bulk submission in your PHP-ICE Group's Shared Locker on myCourses.

**Can you see of how this information about our page vistors is useful? Soon we will learn how to log this data (IP address and user agent) to a file.**
