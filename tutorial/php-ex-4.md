# Exercise: PHP ICE 4

## `$_SERVER` Practice

### Do this now:

1. Duplicate *php-arrays-8.php*,  rename it to **php-3B-HW.php** and:
- add 3 more echo statements that include information on the server's IP address, the server software, and the server "request time".        
- format the server time to be human readable by using PHP's date function:  http://php.net/manual/en/function.date.php

When you are done, it will look something like this:
