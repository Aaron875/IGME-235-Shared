# Web Apps ICE 1

Make a copy of **hello-4.html** and name it **web-apps-2-HW.html**. Delete all of the existing  `console.log()` calls, and add JavaScript that does the following (search the web for documentation if you don't know how to do these):

1. Use a method of the `Array` object to append another color to the end of the `colors` array.
1. Print out the last element in the `colors` array, without hard-coding the index value.
1. Loop through the `colors` array using a `for` loop and print out each value to the console.
1. Add a new property named `school` to the `person` object and give it a value of "RIT". Then print this value to the console.
1. Print out the number of seconds that have passed since 1970 - use the `Date` object.
1. Print out the value of pi - use the `Math` object.
1. Print out the absolute value of -999 - use the `Math` object.
1. Print out an "all caps" version of the string "Hello" - use a method of the `String` object.
