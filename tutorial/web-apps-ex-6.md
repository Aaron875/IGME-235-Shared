# Web Apps ICE 6

Easy - just head back to your **web-apps-ex-3.html** exercise for [4 - More Web Browser DOM Methods](web-apps-4.md), make a copy of the file and name it **web-apps-ex-6.html**, and do the (no longer) optional:

```javascript
 // Can you figure out how to pull the key and value from the "links" object literal?
 // and put them in list with clickable links?
let links = {
		"RIT": "http://www.rit.edu",
		"RWAG" : "https://www.facebook.com/RWAGclub",
		"New Media Club" : "http://newmediaclub.cias.rit.edu"
	}
```
